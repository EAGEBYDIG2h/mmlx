## About

MMLX is a music programming language used to make NES Chiptunes.  It extends from Music Macro Language:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Macro_Language

It is short for MML eXtended. Everything written in MML is valid in MMLX, but there are additional features.

## Dependencies

**setuptools** or **distribute**:

    curl http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py | python

**pip**:

    curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python

this may have to be run as root

## Quick start
    pip install https://github.com/ccampbell/mmlx/zipball/master

* use ADSR envelopes for creating instruments
* import other MMLX files or instruments into your current file
* use portamento to slide smoothly from one note to the next
* store data such as chords or patterns in variables
*Â transpose to any key
* target notes directly by octave without having to manually move up and down octaves
* auto generate NSF files on save and open them

## To-Do
* Throw proper warnings/errors/syntax checks when code is not valid mmlx
* Documentation
* Unit tests
* Automatic DPCM sample conversions from wav files
* Ability to create random instruments
* Ability to use absolute paths to directories
* Ability to generate separate NSF files for different voices

If you are familiar with web programming, MMLX is to MML what SASS is to CSS
