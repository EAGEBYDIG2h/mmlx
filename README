XMML is short for eXtended MML.  It allows you to do things that you cannot do using traditional MML.

XMML allows you to:
- define and use instrument patches
- import other xmml files or instruments into your current file
- use portamento to slide from note to note
- store data such as chords or patterns in variables
-Â transpose to any key
- target notes directly without having to jump up and down octaves
- generate random sounds

To-Do
- Throw proper warnings/errors/syntax checks when code is not valid xmml
- Add documentation
- Add unit tests
- Support ADSR?
- Portamento
